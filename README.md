# NBA Data Analysis and Championship Prediction

Welcome to the NBA Data Analysis and Championship Prediction project! This repository contains code and resources for scraping NBA data from the 1950s until the present and applying machine learning techniques to predict the NBA champion.


## About the Project

The goal of this project is to analyze historical NBA data and build a machine learning model to predict the NBA champion for a given season. By leveraging data spanning several decades, we aim to identify patterns, trends, and factors that contribute to a team's success in the NBA.

## Data Collection

We collected comprehensive NBA data, including player statistics, team performance, and game outcomes, from the 1950s to the current season. The data is sourced from basketball reference. 

## Data Analysis

The `analysis` directory contains Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts for exploratory data analysis (EDA). We explore various aspects of the data, visualize trends, and gain insights into the factors influencing team success.

## Machine Learning Model

The heart of the project lies in the `machine_learning` directory, where we develop, train, and evaluate machine learning models. The predictive model takes into account historical performance metrics, player statistics, and other relevant features to forecast the NBA champion for an upcoming season.
